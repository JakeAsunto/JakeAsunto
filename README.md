# Take a View of My Coding Journey 🙌

I started with making messenger bots from my many fb accounts, and utilized the Facebook-Chat-API that used to work before Meta updated how their API works.
Also, most of us who create bots utilized the coding platform Replit.it, but unfortunately they've added many restrictions to us free users, that running scripts and code 24/7 in their platform is no longer possible.

Well, while currently in this situation, the best thing i can do is, wait till i be 18 and try to support myself in funding for servers to help our community of chatbot creators to deploy and launch their own chatbots, and maybe if i'm getting creative, i'd create new solutions for the chatbot community or even the world, either accidentally or intentionally.

It started in 2021 on a simple group chat i was added in, i was at first confused on how one user in the gc was replying to me so fast, and later realized it was a chatbot with funny commands and replies, i tried to learn how it worked, till it brought me to one of the tutorials of the first makers, it then brought me to Replit where they share and fork the project containing the code for making a Messenger ChatBot then.

This is a true story and is how i turned my obsession with games and technology as a kid and added coding to my list of advanced technological skills for the 21st century.

I still code till this day, i just don't push it to my GitHub often.
